# BoolXRD
BoolXRD is a freeware designed to plot 3D cubic cell structures of crystals depending on their X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) Crystallography data. The "hkl" values obtained from XRD are used to plot the reflecting planes within a cubic cell. In addition, various crystal structures (eg. SC, BCC, FCC) can be simulated and customized in BoolXRD.
further information about this project can be found on its web site.

## BoolXRD v1.4
Since the raw XRD data is still independent of hkl values, there is now a checkbox to determine şf you would like to view your XRd data together with the cubic cell.

"Academic Mode" and "Training Mode" now has been introduced! From now on, you are able to view the cubic structures of common materials (eg. gold, platinum and common salts) meaning that you do not need to have your own data to train yourself about Miller Indices logic, X-Ray Diffraction and etc. 

The number of sample materials will get wider in BoolXRd v1.5, and this means that BoolXRd is not only a data visualization tool, yet it can also be effectively used for practicing XRD applications.

## BoolXRD v1.3
The 'hkl' data are directly imported from an external Excel (.xlsx) data. Hence, they are not derived from the uploaded raw XRD data.

Therefore, raw XRD data is independent of the hkl values uploaded, and the XRD graph is sketched only to present the peaks in the raw data.

Only one type of crystal structure out of SC, BCC, and FCC can be displayed.

The sizes of atoms and transparency of XRD planes can be customized by sliders found in the app.

The "Percentage Intensity" data is used to initialize the opacity of planes to present the most significant planes from the sample.

The destination folder of hkl and XRD data can be easily browsed within the app.
